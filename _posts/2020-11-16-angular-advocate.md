How I became the go-to Angular Advocate at work -- and how you can, too!

<!--more-->

In late spring 2018, my manager approached me with some interesting news. He explained that our executive director had complained that although Angular was prevalent throughout his organization, his own developers were not very experienced with it.

What could be done about that? They discussed various options, from video course subscriptions, to books, to hiring an outside training firm to provide the necessary training.

At that point, my manager spoke up. “What if we ask Mike Callaghan to do it?” He then proceeded to recommend me in an executive meeting to train a group of our software developers how to use Angular.

Before I knew it, I was the Angular Advocate.

# My Angular Journey
I’ve been using Angular since AngularJS 1.2 or so. My first ever Angular app was a mobile swimming coach, implemented with the Ionic Framework and AngularJS.

Today I build web applications with Angular almost exclusively, though I admit to having dabbled briefly with React, even so far as to writing [a book on using React with Ionic](https://gum.co/ionic-react){:target="_blank"}.

When I start a new application, either personally or professionally, I tend to start with Angular.

# What’s in this book?
![Angular Advocate Book](https://walkingriver.com/assets/img/angular-advocate-3d.jpg)

This book consists of a series of essays I have written for various technical audiences over the past year or so. They are either directly or indirectly related to Angular development.

However, this is not a book for web development beginners. There are plenty of those. Instead, this book is designed to appeal to experienced web developers with some exposure or experience with Angular.

The content you will find is, admittedly, opinionated, as is the entire Angular ecosystem.

I describe solutions that worked for me and my team. There are probably other approaches and solutions that would also work, but I will not dwell on them.

The content of this book represents my experience, and I hope you will be able to learn something from it.

## Topics Covered

Here are some of the topics that are covered in the book. Notice it is not all simply Angular. There are other useful subjects that the Angular Advocate needs to understand.
